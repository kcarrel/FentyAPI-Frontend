# Fenty Beauty API


**Authors**: [Katie Carrel](https://kcarrel.github.io/)

## Overview
An example to illustrate the argument that beauty brands should be participating in the API economy. This is an open-source API which provides product information from Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. This information is publicly sourced from [Fenty Beauty](https://www.fentybeauty.com/); I do not claim to own it.

## Technologies used
Ruby on Rails (API), Material UI and React.js

## Routes
**All routes are GET routes**

* **GET /products** - get all products
* **GET /products/${ProductId}** - get product by id
* **GET /name/${ProductName}** - get product by name
* **GET /collection/${ProductCollection}** - get product by collection
* **GET /random** - get a random product

Thank you to [Paige Gorry](https://github.com/paigeegorry) for inspiring me to create my own API!

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
